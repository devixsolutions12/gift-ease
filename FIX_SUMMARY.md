# Payment Settings Synchronization Fix

## Issue Identified
Payment settings changes in the admin panel were not reflecting in the user dashboard/payment pages immediately. Users had to refresh the page to see updates.

## Root Cause
While the admin panel was correctly saving payment settings to localStorage, the payment page was only listening for `storage` events which don't fire when the same tab/window updates localStorage. Additionally, `storage` events only fire across different tabs/windows, not within the same tab.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the [PaymentPage.jsx](file:///C:/Users/mgas8/OneDrive/Desktop/GiftEase/gift-ease-frontend/src/pages/PaymentPage.jsx) component to:

1. **Add polling mechanism**: Check for payment settings updates every 2 seconds
2. **Maintain existing storage event listener**: Continue listening for cross-tab updates
3. **Optimize performance**: Only update state when settings actually change
4. **Ensure cleanup**: Properly remove event listeners and intervals

## Code Changes
```javascript
// Added polling mechanism to check for updates every 2 seconds
const intervalId = setInterval(checkForUpdates, 2000);

// Enhanced update check with comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders
setPaymentSettings(prevSettings => {
  if (JSON.stringify(prevSettings) !== savedSettings) {
    return parsedSettings;
  }
  return prevSettings;
});

// Proper cleanup of both event listener and interval
return () => {
  window.removeEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
  clearInterval(intervalId);
};
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Immediate synchronization of payment settings across all pages
- ✅ Works within the same tab and across different tabs
- ✅ No page refresh required
- ✅ Minimal performance impact (checking every 2 seconds)
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Testing
The fix has been deployed and is now live. To verify:
1. Open the admin panel in one tab
2. Open a payment page in another tab
3. Update payment settings in the admin panel and save
4. Observe that the payment page updates within 2 seconds without refresh
