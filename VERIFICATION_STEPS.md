# Payment Settings Synchronization Verification Steps

## Local Testing (Recommended)

### Test 1: Same Tab Verification
1. Open browser and go to http://localhost:3012/test-sync
2. In the Admin Panel section:
   - Change UPI ID to "sametab@test"
   - Change UPI Name to "Same Tab Test"
   - Click "Save Settings"
3. Observe the User Payment Page section
4. Expected: Should update within 2-3 seconds without refresh

### Test 2: Cross-Tab Verification
1. Open two browser tabs:
   - Tab 1: http://localhost:3012/test-sync
   - Tab 2: http://localhost:3012/packages/play-store
2. In Tab 1:
   - Change UPI ID to "crosstab@test"
   - Change UPI Name to "Cross Tab Test"
   - Click "Save Settings"
3. Watch Tab 2 (payment page)
4. Expected: Should update within 2-3 seconds without refresh

### Test 3: Real Admin Panel Verification
1. Open two browser tabs:
   - Tab 1: http://localhost:3012/admin/login (login as admin)
   - Tab 2: http://localhost:3012/packages/play-store
2. In Tab 1:
   - Navigate to "Payment Settings" tab
   - Change UPI ID to "realadmin@test"
   - Change UPI Name to "Real Admin Test"
   - Click "Save Settings"
3. Watch Tab 2 (payment page)
4. Expected: Should update within 2-3 seconds without refresh

## What to Look For

### In Browser Console (F12):
- "PaymentPage: Started polling for updates every 2 seconds"
- "PaymentPage: Storage event received, updating settings" (cross-tab)
- "PaymentPage: Polling detected settings change, updating" (same-tab)
- "PaymentPage: Cleaning up event listener and interval" (when page unloads)

### On Payment Page:
- UPI ID should match what you entered in admin panel
- UPI Name should match what you entered in admin panel
- Payment instructions should update if changed
- QR Code should update if changed

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Settings don't update immediately
**Cause**: Polling interval might be too long
**Solution**: Current 2-second interval should be sufficient

### Issue 2: Settings update but page doesn't refresh
**Cause**: State comparison logic not working
**Solution**: Fixed with proper JSON.stringify comparison

### Issue 3: localStorage errors
**Cause**: Browser storage restrictions
**Solution**: Ensure browser allows localStorage

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache and localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   ```

2. Restart development server:
   - Stop with Ctrl+C
   - Start with `npm run dev`

3. Check browser console for errors

4. Verify the fix is in place by checking:
   - PaymentPage.jsx has the polling mechanism
   - Admin panel saves to localStorage correctly
   - Comparison logic works properly
