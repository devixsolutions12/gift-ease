# MongoDB Setup Completion Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ You're Almost Done with MongoDB!

Since you've already created your account and added the user/password, you just need to complete a few more steps.

## ðŸ”§ Remaining MongoDB Steps

### Step 1: Network Access Setup

1. In your MongoDB Atlas dashboard, click **"Network Access"** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **"Add IP Address"** button
3. Click **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (this will add 0.0.0.0/0)
4. Click **"Confirm"** button

### Step 2: Get Your Connection String

1. Click **"Database"** in the left sidebar
2. Find your cluster (should be the default one)
3. Click the **"Connect"** button (green button) on your cluster
4. Click **"Connect your application"**
5. Copy the connection string that looks like this:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://gifteaseuser:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
6. **Replace `<password>`** with `gifteasepassword123`
7. Your final connection string should look like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://gifteaseuser:gifteasepassword123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

### Step 3: Save Your Connection String

1. **Copy the complete connection string** to your clipboard
2. **Save it in a text file** on your computer for the next steps
