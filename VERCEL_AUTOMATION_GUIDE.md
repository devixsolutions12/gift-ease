## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If account creation still fails:
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify environment variables in Vercel match exactly
- Ensure Railway backend is running (green status)

### If the application shows old content:
- Make sure you clicked "Redeploy" not just "Visit"
- Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear browser cache

### If you see "Unable to connect to server":
- Double-check your Railway backend URL in Vercel variables
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters in the URL
- Check that Railway application is running

### If environment variables don't seem to work:
- Make sure you used the exact names:
  - `REACT_APP_API_URL` (not `REACT_APP_API_URL ` with space)
  - `VITE_API_URL` (not `VITE_API_URL ` with space)
- Redeploy again after correcting

## üéâ Success Criteria

When Vercel is set up correctly, you should be able to:
- Visit your GiftEase application without "Unable to connect to server" errors
