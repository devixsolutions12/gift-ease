# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Problem: "No repository found" Error

When deploying to Railway, you may encounter the error "No repository found". This is a common issue with several possible causes and solutions.

## Common Causes

1. **Repository Permissions**: Railway cannot access your GitHub repository due to permissions
2. **Private Repository**: Your repository is private and Railway lacks access
3. **Repository Doesn't Exist**: The repository hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet
4. **GitHub Integration Issues**: Railway app isn't properly connected to your GitHub account

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Check Repository Access

1. Run `CHECK_GITHUB_REPO.bat` to verify your repository is accessible
2. Make sure the repository `devixsolutions12/gift-ease-backend` exists on GitHub
3. If it's private, you'll need to grant Railway access

### Solution 2: Grant Railway GitHub Permissions

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/)
2. Click on your profile icon and select "Account Settings"
3. Go to "GitHub Apps" section
4. Install or configure the Railway GitHub App
5. Grant access to your repositories

### Solution 3: Make Repository Public (Temporary)

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Change repository visibility to "Public"
3. Try deploying again on Railway
4. Change back to "Private" after successful deployment

### Solution 4: Use Railway CLI (Recommended)

If GitHub integration continues to fail, use the Railway CLI method:

1. Run `DEPLOY_TO_RAILWAY_USING_CLI.bat`
2. This bypasses GitHub integration entirely
3. Directly deploys your local code to Railway

## Alternative Deployment Methods

### Railway CLI Deployment

1. Install Railway CLI from [https://railway.app/cli](https://railway.app/cli)
2. Run `DEPLOY_TO_RAILWAY_USING_CLI.bat`
3. Follow the prompts to deploy directly from your local machine

## Need Help?

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Double-check that your GitHub repository exists and is accessible
2. Verify Railway has proper permissions to access your repositories
3. Try the Railway CLI deployment method
4. Contact support if problems persist

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. Set all required environment variables in Railway
2. Redeploy your application
3. Copy your Railway backend URL
4. Run `AUTOMATE_VERCEL_CONFIGURATION.bat` to configure your frontend
