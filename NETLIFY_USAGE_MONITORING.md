# Netlify Usage Monitoring for GiftEase

## Overview

This document explains how to monitor your Netlify usage to avoid hitting limits and how to optimize your usage.

## Understanding Netlify Free Tier Limits

The Netlify free tier includes:
- 100GB bandwidth per month
- 300 build minutes per month
- 1000 function invocations per month
- 100 team members
- Custom domains
- SSL certificates

## Monitoring Your Usage

### Through Netlify Dashboard

1. Visit: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Select your project (inspiring-jalebi-9502c5)
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Usage & Billing"
4. Check your current usage statistics

### Through Netlify CLI

```bash
# Check account status
netlify status

# Check detailed account information
netlify api getAccount
```

## Usage Optimization Tips

### 1. Reduce Build Minutes
- Minimize unnecessary builds
- Use `git push` only when you have actual changes
- Consider using Netlify's ignore command for documentation-only changes

### 2. Optimize Bandwidth
- Compress assets (images, CSS, JS)
- Use Netlify's built-in asset optimization
- Implement proper caching headers

### 3. Monitor Function Usage
- If you add serverless functions, monitor their usage
- Optimize function code for efficiency

## Current GiftEase Usage Analysis

### Build Optimization
Your GiftEase project is well-optimized:
- Build time: ~1.6 seconds (very fast)
- Bundle size: ~270KB total (reasonable)
- No serverless functions (saves function invocations)

### Bandwidth Considerations
- Each page load uses ~100-200KB
- 100GB allows for 500,000-1,000,000 page views per month
- Current usage is likely well under this limit

## Warning Signs

Watch for these indicators of approaching limits:
1. Build failures with resource limit errors
2. Site performance degradation
3. Email notifications from Netlify
4. 500 errors on your site

## Cost-Effective Solutions

If you approach limits:
1. Optimize assets further
2. Implement a CDN for images
3. Consider Netlify's Pro plan ($19/month)
4. Use Netlify's analytics to identify high-usage periods

## Best Practices

1. **Deploy Strategically**:
   - Only deploy when you have meaningful changes
   - Group multiple changes into single deployments

2. **Monitor Regularly**:
   - Check usage monthly
   - Set up alerts if possible

3. **Optimize Assets**:
   - Compress images before uploading
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript
   - Use modern formats (WebP for images)

4. **Cache Effectively**:
   - Set long cache times for static assets
   - Use Netlify's built-in caching headers

## For GiftEase Specifically

1. **Admin Panel Usage**:
   - The localStorage-based admin panel doesn't consume Netlify resources
   - All data is stored client-side

2. **Payment Settings Sync**:
   - Our new cloud sync implementation still uses localStorage
   - No additional Netlify costs

3. **Build Efficiency**:
   - Vite build is very fast
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Efficient code splitting

## Emergency Actions

If you hit limits:
1. Temporarily disable automatic deployments
2. Contact Netlify support
3. Consider upgrading to a paid plan temporarily
4. Optimize your site to reduce resource usage
