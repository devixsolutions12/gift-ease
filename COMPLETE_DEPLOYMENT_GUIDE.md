# GiftEase Complete Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Success! Your Frontend is Live

Your frontend is successfully deployed at: https://gift-ease-sand.vercel.app/

However, account creation isn't working because the backend API isn't deployed yet.

## ðŸš€ Complete Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy the Backend API

You need to deploy the backend API to connect your frontend to a working server.

#### Option A: Deploy to Railway.app (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Create a Railway account**: https://railway.app/

2. **Prepare your backend code**:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\mgas8\OneDrive\Desktop\GiftEase\gift-ease-backend"
   ```

3. **Create a new GitHub repository for the backend**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "gift-ease-backend"
   - Don't initialize with README
   - Click "Create repository"

4. **Push backend code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\mgas8\OneDrive\Desktop\GiftEase\gift-ease-backend"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gift-ease-backend.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - Go to your Railway dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your "gift-ease-backend" repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project

6. **Set Environment Variables in Railway**:
   In your Railway project settings, add these environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=8080
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   FRONTEND_URL=https://gift-ease-sand.vercel.app
   ```

7. **Set up MongoDB**:
   - You can use MongoDB Atlas (cloud MongoDB)
   - Create a free cluster at https://cloud.mongodb.com/
   - Get your connection string and add it as MONGODB_URI

#### Option B: Deploy to Render.com

1. **Create a Render account**: https://render.com/

2. **Deploy the backend**:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Click "New Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set these configuration options:
     - Name: gift-ease-backend
     - Environment: Node
     - Build Command: npm install
     - Start Command: npm start
     - Instance Type: Free

3. **Set Environment Variables in Render**:
   Same as Railway, add all the required environment variables.

### 2. Update Frontend Configuration

Once your backend is deployed and you have the URL, you need to update your frontend:

1. **Update Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
     VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
     ```

2. **Redeploy Frontend**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Click "Deployments"
   - Click "Redeploy" for the latest deployment

### 3. Database Setup

The application uses MongoDB. You'll need to set up a MongoDB database:

#### Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)

1. **Create MongoDB Atlas Account**: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. **Create a Free Cluster**
3. **Get Connection String**:
   - Click "Connect" button
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string
   - Replace `<password>` with your actual password

#### Option B: Local MongoDB (for development)

If you want to run MongoDB locally:
1. Install MongoDB: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
2. Start MongoDB service
3. Use connection string: `mongodb://localhost:27017/gift-ease`

### 4. Email Configuration

The application sends email notifications. You'll need to configure email settings:

1. **Gmail Setup**:
   - Use your Gmail address as EMAIL_USER
   - Generate an App Password for EMAIL_PASS:
     - Go to Google Account settings
     - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
     - Generate a new app password for "GiftEase"

### 5. Testing the Complete Setup

After deploying both frontend and backend:

1. **Visit your frontend URL**: https://gift-ease-sand.vercel.app/
2. **Try to register a new account**
3. **Check if you can login**
4. **Test placing an order**

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**:
   - Make sure FRONTEND_URL in backend matches your Vercel URL
   - Check CORS configuration in server.js

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify MONGODB_URI is correct
   - Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
   - Ensure database user has proper permissions

3. **Email Sending Failures**:
   - Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS
   - Check if Gmail 2FA is enabled with App Password

4. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Check if backend URL is correctly set in frontend environment variables
   - Verify backend is running and accessible

### 7. Production Security Considerations

1. **Change Default Credentials**:
   - Update JWT_SECRET to a strong random string
   - Change default admin credentials in seed.js

2. **HTTPS**:
   - Both Vercel and Railway/Render automatically provide HTTPS

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - The backend includes basic rate limiting
   - Adjust limits in middleware/security.js if needed

4. **Input Validation**:
   - All API endpoints include input validation
   - Review and adjust as needed

### 8. Maintenance

1. **Database Backups**:
   - Set up regular backups if using MongoDB Atlas
   - For self-hosted MongoDB, implement backup strategy

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Both Vercel and Railway/Render provide basic monitoring
   - Consider adding application monitoring tools

3. **Updates**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## ðŸŽ‰ Final Result

Once everything is deployed and configured correctly, you'll have:

- A fully functional gift card e-commerce website
- User registration and authentication
- Order management
- Admin dashboard
- Email notifications
- Responsive design for all devices
