## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Make sure you replaced `<password>` in the connection string

- Make sure you added "Allow Access from Anywhere" to Network Access
- Wait a few minutes and try again

## üéâ Success Criteria

When MongoDB is set up correctly, you should be able to:
- Log into MongoDB Atlas anytime with your email/password
